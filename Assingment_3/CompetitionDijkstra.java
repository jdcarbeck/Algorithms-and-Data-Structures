/*
 * A Contest to Meet (ACM) is a reality TV contest that sets three contestants at three random
 * city intersections. In order to win, the three contestants need all to meet at any intersection
 * of the city as fast as possible.
 * It should be clear that the contestants may arrive at the intersections at different times, in
 * which case, the first to arrive can wait until the others arrive.
 * From an estimated walking speed for each one of the three contestants, ACM wants to determine the
 * minimum time that a live TV broadcast should last to cover their journey regardless of the contestantsâ€™
 * initial positions and the intersection they finally meet. You are hired to help ACM answer this question.
 * You may assume the following:
 *    Each contestant walks at a given estimated speed.
 *    The city is a collection of intersections in which some pairs are connected by one-way
 * streets that the contestants can use to traverse the city.
 *
 * This class implements the competition using Dijkstra's algorithm
